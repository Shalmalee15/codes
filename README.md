# codes
1. In this repository, I will add the simple codes which I need often for my work. I will test this with a simple multiplication code. 
2. Added another simple code for reading a csv file data using python. I downloaded this data from https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach//education/senior/astrophysics/stellarevolution_pleiadesact.html . The aim was to read and plot data points in a scatter plot using python. Can use this in future just to read the csv file data. (Problem with the code : It can read only data points in number format. So if your csv file contains a header for the titles of the coloumns, you need to make a small change in the code so as to remove the first line to be omitted from reading it. ) Complete description to be added.
